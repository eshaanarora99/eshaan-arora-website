        <p>
          In high-stakes financial risk management, one of the biggest barriers to action is data paralysis:
          the inability to rapidly synthesize large, fragmented datasets into decisions. This capstone focused
          on moving beyond static retrieval and toward a system that delivers immediate strategic insight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team transitioned from an initial, incomplete metadata set to a comprehensive knowledge base with
          over 1,000 integrated risk drivers, then scaled semantic retrieval by migrating from in-memory storage
          to Chroma DB. During prototyping, we addressed LLM hallucination risk by introducing chat history and
          rerankers. With reciprocal rank fusion, the system prioritized the most relevant documents and improved
          reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final solution achieved a 92% response accuracy rate and transformed the workflow from manual query
          handling into a conversational insight engine producing human-readable summaries for leadership use.

        <p>
          The team worked very hard on this project, and we are very proud of the final product. I want to ensure
          that we all receive due credit as a team: Eshaan Arora, Soham Bidyadhar, Albert Nguyen, Kimberly Simmonds,
          and Isha Verma.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the high-stakes world of financial risk management, leadership teams often face data paralysis, which is
          the inability to quickly synthesize massive, disparate datasets into actionable strategies. Our goal with this
          project was to move beyond simple data retrieval and build a system that delivers immediate strategic insight.
          A key challenge was the quality and consistency of our data sources, so we managed the transition from an
          initial, incomplete metadata set to a comprehensive integration of over 1,000 risk drivers.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure this system could scale, I made the strategic decision to move from in-memory storage to Chroma DB,
          enabling efficient semantic retrieval across a growing knowledge base.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the prototyping phase, I identified a critical user-experience failure where the LLM would occasionally
          hallucinate risk factors not present in the master list. Rather than accepting this, I iterated on the
          architecture by implementing chat history and rerankers. By using reciprocal rank fusion, I was able to
          prioritize the most relevant documents, significantly increasing the reliability of the system. The final
          product achieved a 92% response accuracy rate and transformed the user experience from a manual query process
          into a conversational insight engine that provides human-readable summaries. This allowed leadership to
          identify risk drivers and simulate stress-test scenarios in real-time.
