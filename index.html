        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my website! I’m Eshaan Arora, a passionate problem solver with a deep love for data-driven insights and strategic analysis. My professional journey has been shaped by my time at FIS, where I evolved into the role of Senior Auditor. During my tenure, I had the privilege of working alongside talented individuals, and together, we focused on delivering value-driven insights and recommendations that significantly optimized business operations. My role not only honed my analytical and critical thinking skills but also reinforced my ability to collaborate effectively and navigate complex challenges in a fast-paced environment.
        </p>
  
          <p>
              Beyond my professional pursuits, I have a love for chess—a game that has sharpened my strategic thinking and patience. Additionally, I’m on an exciting personal journey of language learning, with a 600+ day streak on Duolingo where I’ve been immersing myself in Spanish. This journey has deepened my appreciation for culture and communication and keeps me constantly striving for improvement.
          </p>
  
          <p>
              I believe in continuous learning and growth, whether it’s through my work, hobbies, or personal development. Thanks for visiting, and feel free to explore my projects, interests, and more!
