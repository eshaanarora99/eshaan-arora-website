                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my website! I’m Eshaan Arora (pronounced Ee-shawn Aurora), a young professional with a deep love for data-driven insights and strategic analysis. I recently graduated with my MS in Business Analytics at the University of Texas at Austin. This academic journey augmented my knowledge of data science, machine learning, and advanced analytics, preparing me for a dynamic career in data-driven decision-making.</p>

                <p>During my time at Florida State University, I focused on projects that honed my analytical skills and introduced me to the transformative power of data. Whether it’s developing innovative solutions or diving deep into complex datasets, I’m driven by a desire to turn raw information into actionable insights that solve real-world problems.</p>

                <p>Outside of academics and professional development, I enjoy challenging myself with strategic games like chess, which has enhanced my critical thinking and patience. I’m also on a personal journey of language learning, with a 600+ day streak on Duolingo as I immerse myself in Spanish. This experience has deepened my appreciation for diverse cultures and communication.</p>

                <p>As I move forward, my goal is to leverage my skills in data science and analytics to create meaningful impact, helping businesses navigate complex challenges with precision and insight. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore my projects, interests, and more!</p>
