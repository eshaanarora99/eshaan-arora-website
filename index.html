        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my website! I’m Eshaan Arora, a passionate problem solver with a deep love for data-driven insights and strategic analysis. Currently, I’m pursuing a graduate degree in Business Analytics at the McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin. This academic journey is sharpening my expertise in data science, machine learning, and advanced analytics, preparing me for a dynamic career in consulting and data-driven decision-making.</p>
    
        <p>During my time at Florida State University, I focused on projects that honed my analytical skills and introduced me to the transformative power of data. Whether it’s developing innovative solutions or diving deep into complex datasets, I’m driven by a desire to turn raw information into actionable insights that solve real-world problems.</p>
    
        <p>Outside of academics and professional development, I enjoy challenging myself with strategic games like chess, which has enhanced my critical thinking and patience. I’m also on a personal journey of language learning, with a 600+ day streak on Duolingo as I immerse myself in Spanish. This experience has deepened my appreciation for diverse cultures and communication.</p>
    
        <p>As I move forward, my goal is to leverage my skills in data science and analytics to create meaningful impact in consulting, helping businesses navigate complex challenges with precision and insight. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore my projects, interests, and more!</p>
