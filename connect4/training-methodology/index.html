          <h2>Data &amp; simulation pipeline</h2>
          <p>
            The AI opponents are trained using large-scale self-play simulations that generate diverse game situations.
            Each board state is encoded into a structured representation, enabling the models to learn both tactical moves
            and longer-term strategies. This pipeline supports rapid iteration while keeping gameplay behavior consistent
            across different difficulty modes.

          <h2>Model design &amp; trade-offs</h2>
          <p>
            Two modeling approaches power the game. The Casual Mode opponent prioritizes fast responses and consistent play,
            while the Challenge Mode opponent is designed for deeper strategic reasoning. Both models are trained on the same
            data and evaluated side by side, making the trade-offs between responsiveness and difficulty visible to players.

          <h2>Evaluation through gameplay</h2>
          <p>
            Performance is evaluated through automated match simulations and live games against users.
            Beyond win rate, evaluation focuses on responsiveness, predictability, and overall player experience—ensuring
            the AI feels challenging without breaking the flow of play.

          <h2>Future improvements</h2>
          <p>
            The current version is production-ready and playable out of the box.
            You will most certainly enjoy playing against our opponents, just as I have.
            That said, I plan to continue to iterate this game over time.
            Planned enhancements include server-side inference optimizations, skill-based difficulty tiers,
            player rating systems, and tournament-style benchmarking. These additions will make it easier
            to compare strategies, tune difficulty, and improve long-term replayability.
